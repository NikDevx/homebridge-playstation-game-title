# Homebridge Playstation

### Playstation integration for Homebridge.

_Hey Siri, turn on PS5_ finally possible!

<img src="https://github.com/NikDevx/homebridge-playstation/blob/master/PS5%20title%20change.gif?raw=true" width="200">

This integration exposes a Switch service that can be used to switch on/off your PS4/PS5, and determine its current state and show realtime titles of playing game. 

Most of the work is done by the amazing [playactor](https://github.com/dhleong/playactor) library, which this project depends on and [psnawp](https://github.com/isFakeAccount/psnawp)
## Installation

You can install it via Homebridge UI or manually using:
```bash
npm -g homebridge-playstation-game-title
```

**Then <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">install python3</a>**

And install pip3 requirements plugin
```bash
pip3 install PSNAWP
```

## Configuration

- Turn on your PlayStation, go to "Settings" and enable "Remote Play".

- Run this command as `homebridge` user, make sure you don't run these commands as `root` or `pi`, otherwise nothing will work):

```bash
homebridge-playstation-login
```

You can do this by using the Homebridge UI terminal or an SSH session and manually changing user with `su homebridge`

- Open the authorization link provided, authenticate it using your PSN account, and copy the URL when the page shows "redirect" in the terminal.

- On your PlayStation go to "Settings" > "System" > "Remote Play" > "Link Device" and provide the PIN code.

- Restart the HomeBridge instance

- At boot, you should see a message like `"Please add [PS5 XYZ] manually in Home app. Setup Code: 111-22-333"` in the  logs; open the Home app and add your PlayStation as an extra accessory using "Add Accessory" in the top-right menu

## Troubleshooting

If at some point you have any problem, you can try to reset the Homebridge accessory and re-pair it.

To do so, go to Homebridge UI > "Settings" > "Unpair Bridges / Cameras / TVs / External Accessories" and delete the Playstation.

To reset the credentials used by PlayActor, you need to manually remove the directory `/home/homebridge/.config/playactor`
